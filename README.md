# Markov Yelp Reviews

Fun with variable length n-grams and Markov Chains in Python!

## About

Yelp produced a dataset of ~ 4 million customer reviews on ~ 15k businesses. I thought it would be interesting to a build model using n-grams and Markov Chains in an attempt to generate fake (but realistic) reviews from Yelp's review corpus. I decided to build the models from scratch to get the project going.

## Dependencies

I'm in the process of reorganizing these scripts into a more useable package, so I apologize for the lack of SemVer. But below is what you'd definitely need to get these scripts running.

## To Do

This project barely scratches the surface of what can be done with n-grams and Markov chains.  Some directions I'm considering, in addition to other miscellaneous improvements necessary to make the package more useable, are:
