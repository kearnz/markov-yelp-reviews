# Markov Yelp Reviews

Fun with variable length n-grams and Markov Chains in Python!

## About

Yelp produced a dataset of ~ 4 million customer reviews on ~ 15k businesses. I thought it would be interesting to see if I could build models using n-grams and Markov Chains to generate fake (but realistic) reviews from Yelp's review corpus. I decided to build the models from scratch and added in some advanced functionality. While these models are a complete implementation, a lot more can be done to improve the sentences the models generate.

## The Yelp Dataset 

## Dependencies

I'm in the process of reorganizing these scripts into a more useable package, so I apologize for the lack of SemVer. But below is what you'd definitely need to get these scripts running.

Non-Python

* The yelp dataset (~5.5G)

Built-ins

* os
* re
* itertools
* random

Additional

* json
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* sklearn

## To Do

This project barely scratches the surface of what can be done with n-grams and Markov chains.  Below are some examples of directions I'm considering, in addition to other miscellaneous improvements necessary to make the package more useable.
