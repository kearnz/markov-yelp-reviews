    "    - the markov_sentence_one and markov_sentence two are methods to generate random sentences based on corpus\n",
    "        - these methods have multiple optional variables to make the markov model more flexible\n",
    "        - iterations is used for your desired sentence length\n",
    "        - data is the input data you want to use for your project, which defaults to what you use to initialize class\n",
    "        - starter (sentence_two) is the start word you want to use\n",
    "        - gen is used to build the final sentence after n recursive calls\n",
    "        - extend (sentence_two) gives the user the option to extend the sentence until punctuation mark is reached\n",
    "    - finally, the similarity method finds the most similar sentence to the autogenerated markov result\n",
    "        - ideally the result of similarity is low, so the data does not overfit\n",
